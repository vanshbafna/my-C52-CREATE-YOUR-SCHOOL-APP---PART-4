        <h2> A school is a place where we get to know about different 
            activities for the first time. Participating in these
            activities is always memorable and exciting. My favourite
            school event is “MENTAL MATHS COMPETITION”. This event is
            held once in a year. One student is selected from each
            section of a class. Then they are teamed up with other
            students to form three teams. This competition is 
            basically to enhance mental skills. Students have 
            to answer these questions in time span of seconds.
            Questions are not repeated at all and students have
            to be very quick in understanding the questions, in 
            calculations and then answering it. Last year I was
            also selected as one of the finalists. Our team A
            and team C reached the final rounds. The winning 
            round lasted for thirty questions as both teams were 
            not ready to give up. In the end, team C couldn’t answer 
            a question and we answered it to win the event. We were highly
            appreciated and were given certificates and shields.Winning is
            always exciting and encouraging. I would always like to 
            participate in this event again because this event helps me
            in enhancing my mental skills and to speed up my mental 
            calculations. </h2>
